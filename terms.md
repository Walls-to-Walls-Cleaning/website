## Security

### Alarm Systems

Please provide specifics on how we should or should not use the Alarm System. Alarm Companies may provide a specific code for Walls Cleaning Service employees and we are familiar with their use.

The office is secured when not attended. Keys are returned promptly after cessation of service.
