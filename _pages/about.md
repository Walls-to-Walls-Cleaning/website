Walls2Walls Cleaning has been in business for over 5 years. Owners, Sasha and Chris Walls, work
tirelessly to make sure our clients are happy with their homes and the level of cleanliness. After 3 years
of helping clients maintain their homes we decided it was time to re-brand and incorporated in 2017. We
now have over 50 satisfied clients and are adding more every week. We background check all our
cleaners so you can trust we only hire dependable, honest and reliable cleaners. We know how important
it is to you and your family’s overall health and wellness to have a clean, comfortable home. We pride
ourselves in providing the cleanest home possible. You can trust us to make your home a place you can
enjoy making memories with your family. We’re the help you need to keep it clean.

We serve all of Madison, Limestone, Morgan and Marshall counties including Huntsville, Madison,
