    I have never had a housekeeper before and wasn’t sure what to expect! It’s always been something I enjoyed doing myself so I was unsure what to think about asking someone into my home to clean. Sasha did a wonderful job cleaning my home the way I prefer! She came out to meet with me before hand and made sure she knew what I wanted and when and answered all of my silly questions. She cares a lot about the work she does and how important it is to her clients. We plan to have her our regularly now! What a wonderful help!

    Walls2Walls is amazing!! I walked into a CLEAN house and was full of joy that she took such great care of everything that I’d asked of her. I walked into each room with a smile on my face. I am so grateful for Walls2Walls and I will definitely rely on her in the future!
